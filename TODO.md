# Terminal Multiplexer

- Need a good idea to have multiple configs. For now, the only config that needs to change between machines is `i3wm` config, which sets bars and stuff based on monitors. The ideal would be to have a single monitor i3wm config, and a dual monitor one, but I don't know a good way to do this and keep the same installing setup with stow, maybe having a script that before installing will leave only the correct one in the directory.
